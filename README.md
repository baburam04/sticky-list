# Online To-Do List with User Authentication

A Node.js-based backend application designed to manage and serve a list of items through RESTful APIs. This project utilizes Express.js for handling HTTP requests, with a structured approach separating configuration, middleware, models, and routes for scalability and maintainability.

## Features

- **Express.js Server**: Handles HTTP requests and responses efficiently.
- **Modular Architecture**:
  - `config/`: Configuration files.
  - `middleware/`: Custom middleware functions.
  - `models/`: Data models and schemas.
  - `routes/`: API route definitions.
- **RESTful API Endpoints**: Provides endpoints to create, read, update, and delete list items.
- **JSON Data Handling**: Processes and responds with JSON-formatted data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/baburam04/sticky-list.git
   cd sticky-list
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary environment variables.

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
   ```

4. **Start the server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## API Endpoints

Assuming the base URL is `http://localhost:3000`, here are the primary endpoints:

- **GET /items**: Retrieve all items.
- **GET /items/:id**: Retrieve a specific item by ID.
- **POST /items**: Create a new item.
- **PUT /items/:id**: Update an existing item by ID.
- **DELETE /items/:id**: Delete an item by ID.

Ensure to send and receive data in JSON format.
